# STM32H745-Hardware_Semaphore
The hardware semphore peripheral of the STM32H7 Series of microcontroller is explored in this repository where various examples related to the hardware semaphore are covered.  Examples such as Core synchronization, core notification, Resource Sharing etc. are covered currently and more additions will be done in the future as well.  The examples in this repository are running on the STM32H745 NUCLEO Board.  If you want to get more info regarding Hardware semaphore you can refer to the reference manual provided by stmicroelectronics for the same controller family who's link is mentioned below and if any one want video reference they can visit the stmicroelectronics official youtube channel where they have a video's for Hardware Semaphore.
